# Edit: New Boundary

This command creates a new boundary node (also called a spider).
Boundary nodes represent inputs or outputs to the (open) graph.
Boundary nodes are shown as small black circles.

### Behavior
* When no nodes are selected, the new boundary is placed in the center of the screen.  Drag it to the desired location.
* If any nodes were selected, new nodes are created to the right of *every* selected node along with a connecting edge.

### Keyboard shortcuts
* New Boundary: `B`
