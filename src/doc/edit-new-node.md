# Edit: New Node

This command creates a new Z or X node (also called a spider).
Z nodes are shown as (light) green and X nodes are (dark) red.

### Behavior

* If any nodes were selected, a new node is created to the right of one of the nodes with edges connecting it to every selected node.
* If any edges were selected, new nodes are placed in the middle of *every* selected edge with two new edges replace each old edge.

### Keyboard shortcuts
